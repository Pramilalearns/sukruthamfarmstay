    q: "What modern amenities are included in the traditional villa?",
    a: "While our architecture is traditional, our comfort is modern. Each of our 3 bedrooms features high-speed 67 Mbps WiFi (perfect for remote work or streaming), air conditioning, private bathrooms with hot water, and a shared fully-equipped kitchen with a microwave, refrigerator, and washing machine. You get the charm of the past with the convenience of the present.",

    q: "Is the entire property accessible for elderly guests or wheelchair users?",
    a: "Yes. Accessibility was a priority in our design. The entire 2,800 sq. ft. villa is located on the ground floor with no stairs, making it fully wheelchair accessible and very easy for elderly guests or those with mobility challenges to move around comfortably.",
  },
  {
